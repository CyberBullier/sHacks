# Future of Banking 

* Commercial Banking 
⋅⋅* Mobile Integration 
⋅⋅* Rise of widespread mobile banking as deposits, cheques, and investments migrate from traditional/web platforms to mobile
Non-cash transactions 
An increasingly diminishing portion of transactions occur using cash due to the rise of convenience apps (uber, instacart, skip the dishes, etc) and mobile banking 
ATMs will be obsolete 
Transaction Efficiency 
Back-office efficiency will increase with automation of loan processing, deposits, or transfers as well as customer service, lowering transaction costs and frictional inefficiencies for everyday customers 
This has bled into the broker industry, with apps like Robinhood and Questrade offering competitively lower transaction fees for public equity purchases due to fully automated broker processes 
Negligible or reduced fees makes transactions more accessible to people of all income levels, and makes the commercial market more efficient in the long run 
Biometric Security 
Recent developments in biometric security include  facial recognition via smartphone cameras, fingerprinting, and instantaneous ID verification ensures that identity verification can be done more accurately and quickly than using traditional human methods
This will result in lowered rates of fraud and identity theft 

* Corporate & Investments
Deal Closing & Negotiations 
AI and automated processes can help reduce deal closing times by gathering data and scaping reports (such as annual reports, 10-K, etc) more efficiently 
Due diligence 
Due diligence is often an incredibly precise, detailed, and data-based task. The process can be made considerably more efficient using automated processes 
Valuations & Forecasting 
As resources like Bloomberg Terminal and CapIQ become more intelligent, they can begin to perform rudimentary valuation and modelling work, such as forecasting and historical valuation, otherwise performed by analysts 
Valuations and forecasting values vary greatly due to human bias during the construction process; integrating a central machine intelligence to consistently perform these tasks will lower the variation of these models
